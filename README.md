codingcircle contains the examples from the YouTube Coding Cirle.

## Quick start

So far, the following exercises have been covered:

- [Autocomplete](./autocomplete/) – implements an autocomplete feature using a trie
- [Cons, Car, Cdr & co.](./cons) – implements a cons cell and the corresponding functions
- [Continous maximum](./continuousmax/) – calculates the maximum of a sliding window
- [Floyd](./floyd/) – implements Floyd's cycle-finding "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm
- [Heap](./heap/) – implements a heap from scratch, without using the built-in `container/heap` package
- [Radix sort](./radixsort/) – implements radix sort
- [Remove k-th last element](./removekthlastelement/) – removes the k-th last element from a single-linked list
- [Run-length encoding](./runlengthencoding/) – encodes and decodes strings using run-length encoding
- [Running median](./runningmedian/) – calculates the running median of a sequence of numbers
- [Tic tac toe](./tictactoe/) – detects winnning states in a tic tac toe game

## Running quality assurance

To execute the tests run the following command:

```shell
$ make
